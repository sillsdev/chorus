namespace Chorus.notes
{
	/// <summary>
	/// This class is a repository for finding a handler which can display additional information
	/// about a message based on some interpretation of a CDATA section in the message.
	/// The only current implementation (MergeConflictEmbeddedMessageContentHandler) uses WinForms
	/// and was therefore moved to Chorus, since it is a current goal that LibChorus should not
	/// reference WinForms.
	/// MergeConflictEmbeddedMessageContentHandler understands the CDATA that is embedded in
	/// MergeConflict notes, and creates a link that offers more details of the conflict.
	/// We use MEF to add an implementation in an assembly which it does not reference.
	/// It also knows about DefaultEmbeddedMessageContentHandler which should come last.
	/// It also finds any implementations in Chorus.exe, if that is found in the same directory.
	///
	/// Note that the handlers are tried in order until we find one which CanHandleUrl for a
	/// particular URL. Thus the order in which they are stored in KnownHandlers is potentially
	/// important. So far, all we need to know is that the Chorus one comes before the default one,
	/// which trivially handles anything. If at some point we have multiple ones in Chorus
	/// (or elsewhere) which could handle the same URLs, we will need to add an ordering
	/// mechanism...either by how we configure MEF, or perhaps by adding a "priority" key to
	/// IEmbeddedMessageContentHandler.
