		/* CJH 2011-09-19
		 * In the process of separating out the Push and Pull functionality from HgRepository, I realized that too many private methods needed to become public
		 * in order to fully extract the Push and Pull methods.  This is likely because there are methods on HgRepository that have little to do with the
		 * model and more to do with the HgRunner class and executing Hg commands.  A future refactoring might include moving functionality from HgRepository over
		 * to HgRunner, for example methods like Execute() and SurroundWithQuotes()
		 *
		 * The scaffolding is set to move the Push and Pull functionality out of HgRepository and into here.  For now though we just call the appropriate
		 * "normal service" methods on HgRepository. The "resumable service" methods are implemented outside of HgRepository in its own transport class.
