	Chorus will allow you to share files between team members.  In this version, only sharing via USB keys is enabled.
		</span>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif"><strong>Step 1: </strong>Begin by having one team member start a repository which holds the files you want to share.&nbsp;
		If your application (e.g. FLEx or WeSay) is Chorus-ready, open your project and
		give the "Sync" command.&nbsp; This will create a repository and check your work
		into it.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif"><strong>Step 2: </strong>Prepare a USB Key for backup &amp; sharing.</span></p>
		<p>
			<input id="Button2" type="button" value="Prepare USB Key" style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif" /><span
				style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif">
			Now that you have a reposistory on a USB key, you can always plug it in and quickly
			sync with it.&nbsp; This will not only backup your work to the key, but will do
			so in a way that preserves the entire history of your work since you started using
			Chorus.&nbsp; You can prepare as many keys as you like and rotate them however you
			like, for multiple backups.&nbsp; Make sure to keep one or more of the keys away
			from the computer, in case of fire, flood, or theft.</span></p>
 <p>
	 <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif"><strong>Step 3: </strong>Take a USB key which holds a repository to the computers of other team members, run Chorus, and copy the repository.</span></p>
 <p><input
	 id="Button3" type="button" value="Copy Repository From USB Key To This Computer" style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif" />&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: MS Sans Serif"><strong>
		Step 4: </strong>For WeSay, start using the project.&nbsp; For FLEx, (what???)</span></span></p>
		<p>
			[this it the step I'm most confused about. It could be that each app needs its own
			instructions at this point]</p>
		<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif"><strong>Step 5:</strong> If
			this repository you have open now should be protected as a "master"/"gold" version of the database,&nbsp; indicate that in the settings panel.<br />
			<br />
		</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif">
		This will cause Chorus to share changes made on the master with the rest of the
		team, but the master will not pull in work from anyone else.&nbsp; Eventually, your
		applications (e.g. FLEx) will make it easy to view proposed changes from the team
		and selectively bring them into the master.</span><h3>
				<span style="font-family: MS Sans Serif">Sharing Work</span></h3>
	   <p>
		   <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif">On a regular basis, do a Sync to a USB Key and take/send it to your other team members. Have each one sync with it.  Each member will get all the work, of all the members, that the key has seen. Where there are conflicts, this version of Chorus will choose
		   to keep the incoming work at the expense of the existing work.&nbsp; The conflict
		   will show up in the log, and will eventually be easy to reconsider from within your
		   application (e.g. FLEx or WeSay).&nbsp; </span>
	   </p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: MS Sans Serif">
			In the near furture, you will be able to register the locations of non-USB repositories
			here.&nbsp; These will include paths over a Local Area Network for teammembers in
			the same office, and an internet address for a Chorus-compatible server, for team
			members located far from each other.</span></p>
